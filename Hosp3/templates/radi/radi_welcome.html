            <h5>Ultrasound imaging (sonography) uses high-frequency sound waves to view inside the body.
                Because ultrasound images are captured in real-time,
                they can also show movement of the body's internal organs as well as blood flowing through the blood vessels.
                Unlike X-ray imaging, there is no ionizing radiation exposure associated with ultrasound imaging.
                In an ultrasound exam, a transducer (probe) is placed directly on the skin or inside a body opening.
                A thin layer of gel is applied to the skin so that the ultrasound waves are transmitted from the transducer through the gel into the body.
